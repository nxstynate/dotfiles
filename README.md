# 🚀 My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal **dotfiles** for configuring my development environment. It includes configurations for tools like **WezTerm, Neovim, PowerShell, Starship, and more**. These dotfiles are managed using **symbolic links**, allowing for easy synchronization across multiple machines.

## 📂 Structure

- **setup_symlinks.ps1** → Creates symlinks for all dotfiles
- **update_dotfiles.ps1** → Commits and pushes updated dotfiles to GitHub
- **.gitconfig** → Git configuration
- **Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1** → PowerShell customizations
- **nvim/** → Neovim configuration
- **wezterm/** → WezTerm configuration
- **starship.toml** → Starship prompt settings
- **settings.json** → Windows Terminal settings
- **startup-script.bat** → Startup script for Windows

## 🔧 Installation

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git $HOME\dotfiles
cd $HOME\dotfiles
```

### **2️⃣ Run the Setup Script**
This will create symbolic links from your home directory to the stored dotfiles.
```powershell
.\setup_symlinks.ps1
```

### **3️⃣ Done! 🎉**
Your environment is now configured with the correct settings.

---

## 🔄 Updating Dotfiles

After modifying any configuration file, **commit and push** your changes:
```powershell
.\update_dotfiles.ps1
```

To **sync changes on another machine**, simply run:
```powershell
git pull origin main
.\setup_symlinks.ps1
```

---

## 💻 Setting Up a New Machine

For a fresh install, run:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git $HOME\dotfiles
cd $HOME\dotfiles
.\setup_symlinks.ps1
```

For additional software installation, you can use **Windows Package Manager (winget)**:
```powershell
winget install Starship WezTerm Neovim.Git PowerShell
```

---

## ❗ Troubleshooting

### **💡 Symlink Issues**
If symbolic links fail to create, make sure you **run PowerShell as Administrator**.

### **💡 GitHub Authentication Issues**
If you're getting errors when pushing to GitHub:
```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://yourusername@github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git
```
Or use **SSH authentication** instead:
```powershell
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yourusername/dotfiles.git
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- [ ] Automate new machine setup with an `install.ps1` script
- [ ] Add additional configurations for tools like Tmux, Zsh, and VS Code
- [ ] Explore automated syncing with Windows Task Scheduler

## 📜 License
Feel free to use and modify these dotfiles to suit your needs. Happy coding! 🎨✨

### **How to Use This**
1. Save this as `README.md` in your GitHub repo.
2. Customize the **GitHub repo URL** (`yourusername/dotfiles`).
3. Add more details or commands if needed.
4. Commit and push the README to GitHub:
   ```powershell
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Added README file"
   git push origin main
   ```

Now, your repo has **clear documentation** that makes it easy to install, update, and troubleshoot! 🚀🔥 Let me know if you want tweaks! 😊
